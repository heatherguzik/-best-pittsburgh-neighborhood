    "The main metric we used to determine the best neighborhood in the City of Pittsburgh is overall quality of life. To do this, we used 3 sub-metrics: safety, affordability, and environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "In order to determine how safe a neighborhood is, we utilized a dataset that tracks information about arrests. We used the logic that the fewer the arrests in a neighborhood, the safer that neighborhood is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Affordability\n",
    "To determine the affordability of a neighborhood, we used a dataset that included the estimated total rent price. The lower the average rent price, the more affordable the neighborhood is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "Finally, to decide the quality of the environment in a neighborhood, we used a dataset which logged each tree in a neighborhood. The neighborhoods with the highest number of trees are the best for the environemnt."
