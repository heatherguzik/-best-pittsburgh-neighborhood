    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final project asks us to find the \\\"best neighborhood in Pittsburgh\\\" using data from the WPRDC. Our approach to this project was immediately to find the best neighborhood to live in. We didn't have issue finding submetrics to base this on: the neighborhood you want to live in is the safest, cheapest, and nicest-looking one. Other alternatives like pollution, recycling, or simply how mindful a negihborhood is was looked at as well, but in the end the best neighborhood is the one with the most livable qualities."

    "## The Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The main metric we used to determine the best neighborhood in the City of Pittsburgh is overall quality of life. To do this, we used 3 sub-metrics: safety, affordability, and environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "In order to determine how safe a neighborhood is, we utilized a dataset that tracks information about arrests. We used the logic that the fewer the arrests in a neighborhood, the safer that neighborhood is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Affordability\n",
    "To determine the affordability of a neighborhood, we used a dataset that included the estimated total rent price. The lower the average rent price, the more affordable the neighborhood is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "Finally, to decide the quality of the environment in a neighborhood, we used a dataset which logged each tree in a neighborhood. The neighborhoods with the highest number of trees are the best for the environemnt. "

    "### Heather's Conclusion\n",
    "Based on the data within the datasets we used, we came to the conclusion that Allegheny West is the neighborhood with the best quality of life in the City of Pittsburgh. While I have personally never spent much time in this area, it seems like a good choice due to its standing when it comes to safety, affordability, and environment. However, my personal favorite neighborhood is Squirrel Hill, as I have spent the most time here and there is a lot to do. However, Squirrel Hill is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, so it did not perform well in our metric of affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joshua's Conclusion\n",
    "Allegheny West was the neighborhood that hit the most metrics at once. Across our three data sets we looked for one neighborhood that had the lowest arrests while also having low average cost and high amount of trees. No other neighborhood above Allegheny West (except maybe Ridgemont who had lower arrests and lower cost but too few trees) met as many metrics. I haven't been in Pittsburgh long but when I drove by Allegheny West I remember feeling it was a nice looking nieghborhood. The greenery was well placed, the buildings looked a little old, but overall it was very scenic. I'd agree with our assestment for \"best neighborhood\" in terms of the best neighborhood I'd want to actually live in. "
