Data Description:
- Arrest Data (analyzed by Joshua):

    "Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level."

- Contract Data (analyzed by Joshua and Heather):
  
    "The data on contract rent (also referred to as “rent asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 18a in the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview... Contract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview... Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars."
